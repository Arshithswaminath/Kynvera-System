## 🎨 Design Consistency

### **Pending Reviews Page**

- Uses same color scheme:
  - Primary: `#125435` (Injaaz Green)

## 💡 Technical Details

### **Badge Count Logic**
```javascript
// On dashboard.html - runs on page load
async function loadPendingCount(user) {
  // Fetch /api/workflow/submissions/pending
  // Extract count
  // Update badge: document.getElementById('navPendingBadge')
  // Show/hide based on count (0 = hide badge)
}
```

### **Role-Based Visibility**
```javascript
const reviewerDesignations = [
  'operations_manager',
  'business_development', 
  'procurement',
  'general_manager'
];

// Show Pending Review button only for reviewers
if (user.designation in reviewerDesignations || user.role === 'admin') {
  showPendingReviewButton();
}
```

### **Click-to-Review**
```javascript
async function openSubmissionForReview(submissionId, moduleUrl) {
  // Navigate to: /{moduleUrl}/form?edit={submissionId}&review=true
  window.location.href = `/${moduleUrl}/form?edit=${submissionId}&review=true`;
}
```
